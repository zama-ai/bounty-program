Zama’s aggregate liability under the Program shall in any case be limited to the Bounty paid or payable to Contributor. Contributor agrees that this Article represents a reasonable allocation of risk and constitutes an essential clause of these GTC, in the absence of which these GTC would not have been executed and the Contributor’s participation in the Program would not have been validated by Zama.

Contributor expressly agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Zama, its officers, employees, clients, partners, subcontractors and affiliates against any and all losses, expenses and damages, occasioned by any claim, action or recovery by any party (including any governmental or non-governmental agency or organization) brought against Zama, its officers, employees, clients, partners, subcontractors or any of its affiliates to the extent arising out of the use of the Contribution in any way or in any form both during and after the expiration or termination of these GTC.

Contributor is fully liable for any disclosure of Vulnerabilities or other Contributions following the Program completion for which legitimate suspicions may be raised against Contributor.

### Article 9. Processing of Personal Data

Contributor has entered into the Program and these GTC including, incidentally, the processing of personal data under Law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as well as under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as of April 27, 2016 on the Protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (the "GDPR"). Zama and Contributor will comply with the legislation in force, in all its developments concerning the processing of personal data.

Zama and Contributor consider that all operations carried out on personal data, if any, are carried out only within the framework of the execution of the Program and these GTC.

Zama and Contributor acknowledge that, within the framework of their contractual relationship, each party acts as controller of the personal data that it processes for their respective needs. Each party is therefore solely responsible for the use of personal data that it makes for its own account independently of the other party. Each party acknowledges that it may communicate or transmit personal data to the other party for the performance of its obligations under these GTC. Each party warrants that such personal data is processed and transmitted in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
Each party implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks associated with the processing, these measures being in particular appropriate to protect against destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized, accidental or unlawful disclosure of personal data processed under these GTC. These measures must take into account the state of the art, the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risk of damage resulting from unauthorized or unlawful processing, or loss, destruction or alteration, accidental or unlawful, of personal data.

Pursuant to Article 15 of the GDPR, each party guarantees that it provides the data subjects with all the information requested concerning the processing of their personal data. In accordance with Articles 13, 14, 16, 17 and 21 of the GDPR, each party acknowledges that the persons concerned have a right of access, rectification, portability, erasure of their personal data or opposition to their use. When it deems it necessary, each party undertakes to communicate to the other any request that it may receive directly from a data subject exercising its aforementioned right concerning it and expressly referring to  the other party.

The retention period for the Contributor's personal data is 10 (ten) years unless legal acts require a more extended retention period. Upon expiration of the Contributor's data retention period, Zama shall erase the data.

Zama and Contributor agree that, at the end of their contractual relationship, the archiving of the documents containing the said personal data will be carried out in accordance with the legislation in force, for the legal duration applicable to the documents which contain them and, in any case, the parties will allow the persons concerned to exercise their rights, within the limits permitted by the legislation in force, if they so request.

### Article 10. Confidentiality

Contributor has an obligation to keep confidential all information to which Contributor had access or which it may have possessed in the context of the participation in the Program. Consequently, Contributor shall not disclose such information to any third party for any reason whatsoever and this regardless of the legal and/or economic ties that Contributor has with such a third party.

Contributor expressly agrees that the Vulnerability and other Contributions shall be deemed the Zama’s confidential information and Contributor shall not publish, discuss or disclose the Vulnerability and other Contributions to any third parties without Zama’s prior written approval which will not be unreasonably withheld.

This commitment will last for the entire duration of the contractual relationship between Contributor and Zama and will continue beyond the end of this contractual relationship occurring for any reason whatsoever, for as long as the confidential information has not fallen into the public domain by disclosure of the information by Zama.

At the end of the Contributor's participation in the Program, all information related to the Program, namely, data of any kind, including reports made by the Contributor, will be completely deleted from Contributor's databases and systems.

Failure to comply with this Article 10 and the requirement of confidentiality will automatically  jeopardise the Bounty and also create risk of legal action, and Contributor expressly agrees to fully indemnity Zama for any losses as a result of such breach of these provisions.

### Article 11. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction

The Program and these GTC are governed by, and shall be construed in accordance with French law without its conflict of law provisions.
All disputes arising out of or in connection with the construction, performance, termination or invalidity of the Program or/and these GTC shall be resolved by negotiation between the parties.

If the parties have not resolved the dispute by coming to mutual agreement during twenty (20) calendar days  after setting a notice on the dispute, Zama and Contributor give express and exclusive jurisdiction to the appropriate courts within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal of Paris, France notwithstanding a plurality of defendants or plaintiffs or summary proceedings or third party claim or precautionary measure or appeals.

### Article 12. Miscellaneous

#### 12.1. Severability

Should one or more of the provisions of these GTC be declared null and void in accordance with applicable law, they shall be deemed to be not written, and the other provisions herein shall remain in full force and effect. Such null and void provisions shall be replaced by the parties with the valid provisions allowing the parties to achieve the effect that was contemplated by the provisions declared null and void, to the extent possible.

#### 12.2. Non waiver

Failure by one of the parties to enforce any clause of these GTC, whether permanently or temporarily, shall under no circumstance be construed as a waiver of the rights of the said party under the said clause.
