# Create a tutorial for new models with Concrete-ML
`Machine Learning`

## ✅ Solution
- See the tutorial for LinearSVC here
- See the tutorial for LinearSVR here
- See the tutorial for DecisionTreeRegressor here

## Overview
Create tutorials for various models available in Concrete-ML

## Description
Create tutorials for models which do not have tutorials, i.e.:
- one tutorial for LinearSVC
- one tutorial for LinearSVR
- one tutorial for DecisionTreeRegressor

The tutorials need to be very educative, pedagogical and help the user understand how Concrete-ML is to be used. The tutorial(s) must use Virtual Library and FHE computations. It is even better if tutorials use a real-life kind of dataset. We want the tutorials to be as complete and to have as much quality as [Linear Regression tutorial](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/0.5.x/docs/advanced_examples/LinearRegression.ipynb) or the [Poisson Regression tutorial](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml/blob/release/0.5.x/docs/advanced_examples/PoissonRegression.ipynb).

For tutorials bounties, we expect candidates to:

- provide a PR on the public https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete-ml (or a fork of it), with just a few new file, ideally a single Jupyter notebook
- to have a very detailed notebook, written in a pedagogical way, with an emphasis in the new section(s), i.e., what makes this notebook different from other notebooks

If one needs to modify the library to have the tutorial, it is ok, but then, rules of SW apply as well.
