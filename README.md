## 💰 About the Bounty Program

The Zama Bounty Program offers monetary rewards for tackling specific challenges.

This initiative aims to inspire and incentivize the developer community to create FHE applications and address problems that can drive FHE technology forward by a decade! Therefore, our Bounty program emphasizes innovation and contribution, rather than bug fixes.  

Each season, we introduce bounties targeting a specific Zama library ([Check Season 5 bounties](https://github.com/orgs/zama-ai/projects/27/views/1)). All submissions are evaluated based on the quality of the code, and more importantly the speed performance. At the end of each season, we reward up to 3 submissions per bounty.

>[!Note]
> All our benchmarks are run on Amazon EC2 HPC7A instances.

### Important dates
- **Season 5 is now over:** Winners will be announced along their solutions in the coming days. Season 6 is coming soon.
