## 🎉 Welcome to the Zama Bounty Program 

[Zama](https://github.com/zama-ai) is a cryptography company working on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and other tools that make protecting privacy easy. We started this <em>experimental</em> bounty program to encourage developers from the community to collaborate with us in advancing the FHE space!

The Zama Bounty Program offers monetary rewards for tackling specific challenges.

This initiative aims to inspire and incentivize the developer community to create FHE applications and address problems that can drive FHE technology forward by a decade! Therefore, our Bounty program emphasizes innovation and contribution, rather than bug fixes.<br></br>

## ❓FAQ


### How often is the list of bounties updated?

Season 1 was launched during Q4-2022. A season usually lasts several weeks to months in order to give contributors enough time to work on their submisssions.

### How long will it take for a bounty submission to be reviewed?

We are reviewing most of the submissions at the end of every season. But feel free to submit your code at anytime through the submission link you received.

### How are bounty submissions reviewed?

Every contribution to the bounty program is reviewed as a code submission. If the code does not meet the quality or the performance expected, the proposition will be rejected, or partially rewarded.


### What is the reward for the bounty program?
Each bounty is attributed a total enveloppe of €10,000 in rewards.
  
#### 🥇Best submission: up to €5,000.
To be considered best submission, a contribution must be efficient, effective and demonstrate a deep understanding of the core problem. Alongside the technical correctness, it should also be submitted with a clean code, clear explanations and a complete documentation.

#### 🥈Second-best submission: up to €3,000.
For a contribution to be considered the second best submission, it should be both efficient and effective. The code should be neat and readable, while its documentation might not be as exhaustive as the best submission, it should cover the key aspects of the contribution.

The third best submission is one that presents a contribution that effectively tackles the challenge at hand, even if it may have certain areas of improvement in terms of efficiency or depth of understanding. Documentation should be present, covering the essential components of the contribution.
